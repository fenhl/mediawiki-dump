**This project is looking for a new maintainer** since I don't use MediaWiki anymore and don't have any database dumps to test with. If you're interested, open an issue.

This is a command-line tool that extracts articles from a [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org/) database dump created using [`php dumpBackup.php --current`](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:DumpBackup.php) into a directory structure with one file containing the source of each page.
